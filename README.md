# d3-tests

Playing around with d3 and TypeScript.  I try to keep a live demo of this code up to date at
http://www.proofbyexample.com/demos/d3-tests/.

## Status

Hack

## Development

* `npm install`
* `npm run build:watch`
* Then, in another terminal run a web server in the project root (I use
  `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)
* Then load index.html in a browser
